Applelytics – Custom Apple Configuration & Order Analytics System

A backend-driven Apple device configuration and analytics system built using Python, SQLite, Pandas, NumPy, and data visualization techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Applelytics is a configuration-based ordering system that allows users to customize Apple devices and analyze sales data.

Unlike a simple configuration program, this system integrates:

Dynamic pricing logic

Persistent SQLite database storage

Structured order logging

Data analytics and visualization

Google Drive-based permanent database integration

The project simulates a real-world backend workflow combined with data analytics.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

SQLite

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab

Google Drive Integration

🔄 Project Workflow

User selects device configuration options (Model, Variant, Storage, Color, Refresh Rate, Accessories)

System calculates total price dynamically

Order data is stored in a persistent SQLite database

Data is retrieved and processed using Pandas

Numerical analysis is performed using NumPy

Clean dataset is exported to CSV

Visualizations are generated for analytical insights
